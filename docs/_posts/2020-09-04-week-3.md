# How To Install Docker on Ubuntu

Docker is an excellent resources for both the IT and Computer Science field.

It allows developers to quickly build and deploy images of their applications, with easy maintenance and automation.

Ever had that common issue during development and testing of "*well it works on my computer*". Thanks to Docker, you can go ahead and package that working copy into an image that can be installed an ran on anyone else's machine that also has Docker!

Installing Docker itself is very simple, and below is a tutorial for installing Docker on a Linux (Ubuntu) machine:

 1. Navigate to Docker's repo pool to find your version of Ubuntu and download the .deb file at https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists
 2. Select your distro version and navigate to pool/stable/
 3. Select amd64, armhf, or arm64 depending on your system architecture and download the .deb file
 4. To run the .deb installer navigate to the downloaded file location through your console and run: "sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb"
 5. The installer will automatically run and begin installing Docker for your Ubuntu system, the daemon (background process) for Docker will automatically start upon completion of the installation

You can now verify that Docker has been successfully installed by running the default 'hello-world' image as follows:
'sudo docker run hello-world'

If it succeeds, you'll receive a hello world message confirming the successful installation of Docker!
