## Using the nslookup command

Ever had an issue where a website or an IP address isn't resolving? In some cases, it can be more complicated than just the server being down. A possibility is that the DNS server isn't resolving it, which is why you're unable to reach the destination.

You can check to see if a website is resolving by using the `nslookup` command, which tells you whether the website or IP address is being routed through a DNS server and successfully points to it.

The command can be used like so:
`nslookup [domain or ip address]`

For example, running `nslookup www.csun.edu` should result in the following:
Server:		2603:8000:9b01:1da8::1
Address:	2603:8000:9b01:1da8::1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	www.csun.edu
Address: 130.166.238.195

This shows that my DNS is functioning and able to reach CSUN.edu's website and IP address.

This is important for debugging, because if an IP address to a destination is changed, you may still be using the cached IP address from the DNS query, which could result in problems trying to access the URL or IP address. By running an nslookup, it can help with identifying whether you're reaching the correct destination and helping identify which layer the issue is occurring from.
