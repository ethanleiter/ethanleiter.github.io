## Using the ping command
In most operating systems, there are a number of useful commands through the command line interface, which most users are not familiar with, but more technical users are.

One of the most useful commands, is the `ping` tool.

This tool allows you to send a packet to a destination through an IP address, which then responds back (unless this isn't configured) to confirm a successful delivery.

This can be done by going into the terminal or command prompt/powershell for Windows users, and inputting `ping [destination IP]` in the console and pressing enter.

You're also not limited to just IP addresses, but can also ping local systems on your network with the computer name, or domains if they resolve through DNS (local or global) as well. Such as: `ping www.csun.edu` which can be used to resolve the CSUN website's IP address to `130.166.238.195`.

If the request times out, it may mean that the server is down or configured to not resolve when a ping request is sent.

This trick is also useful when adding parameters such as a number or continuous ping, when you're trying to troubleshoot issues with packet loss or want to check your network connectivity.
