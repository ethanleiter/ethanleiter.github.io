## Russian Roulette using Linux

This is just a little fun blog post demonstrating a simple script that can be used in Linux.

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, DO NOT RUN THIS ON ANYTHING IMPORTANT**

The code is as follows:
`[ $[ $RANDOM % 6] = 0 ] && rm -rf / --no-preserve-root || echo "Click"`

The way this works is that it runs the command directly in your shell, the `$RANDOM` generates a random number and modulos it by 6 (to signify a revolver like in traditional Russian Roulette). If the number is equal to 0, then the command will wipe out all data on the instance. The `--no-preserve-root` flag is used because in more recent versions of Linux, there were steps taken to require user confirmation prior to running a massive delete like in this example. By including this parameter, there is no prompt to the user requesting confirmation and the command immediately begins mass deleting everything from the root directory.

If you're lucky while running this command, then the console will return "Click", indicating that it was an empty run and nothing was deleted.

Again, please do not run this on anything important. Feel free to spin up a VM and try it on there. This is just for fun and can be very dangerous if not used in a responsible manner.
