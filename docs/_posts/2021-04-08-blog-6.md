## How to install MySQL on Ubuntu

Running a database is important for any application. Databases make it easy to store and access data, whether it is a person's contact information or encrypted login info, it's normally stored in a database such as SQL or NoSQL.
<br>
The easiest and free database to install, is MySQL, which can quickly be done in Ubuntu.
<br>
The first step is installing Apache as a web interface for the database. Run the following commands:
`sudo apt update`
<br>
`sudo apt install apache2`

Once Apache has been installed, you can start the service by running:
`sudo service apache2 start`

You can verify that Apache is running by visiting the server IP address or if you're on the machine, running to http://localhost or http://SERVER.IP.ADDRESS.HERE
<br>

Now you'll need to include the minimum PHP dependency modules for the interface that will connect with the MySQL Database Server:
`sudo apt install php php-gettext libapache2-mod-php`

After the PHP dependencies have been installed, we can now install the database server:
`sudo apt install mysql-server`

You'll need to answer a few questions, such as setting the default password for the root user as the MySQL Server installation proceeds.

<br>

Once MySQL Server has been installed, you can access the database by authenticating as the root user that was created during the installation:
`sudo mysql -u root -p` and insert the password you created for the user while proceeding through the installation.

<br>

You'll need to exit the MySQL Server with the following command:
`mysql> exit;`

<br>

Most people prefer working with databases in a GUI, it's much easier to read everything compared to the command-line interface, and you can do so by quickly installing PHPMyAdmin, which is a simple PHP-based interface that connects to the MySQL Server:
`sudo apt install phpmyadmin`

After the installation has completed, please restart the Apache web server:
`sudo service apache2 restart`

Once Apache has restarted, you can now access the MySQL Database Server through a web interface by the same URL as before with PHPMyAdmin appended at the end:
`http://localhost/phpmyadmin` and sign in with the root user and password from the MySQL Server installation!
