## DDOS Protection
This post is a continuation of my [previous post](https://ethanleiter.github.io/security/dos/ddos/2020/11/06/blog-9.html) where I discussed what a DOS and DDOS are.

While a solid DDOS attack can be purchased for less than the price of a Starbucks drink through sites that will not be named here for liability reasons, there are options to help defend against these types of attacks.

# DNS Filtering
You can utilize DDOS protection services such as [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) which route your DNS through their infrastructure that has automated features to detect common types of DDOS attacks such as packet flooding and DNS amplification, and help mitigate it before it hits your server.

Here are a few DDOS protection services that offer filtering at the DNS level:
	- [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/ddos)
	- [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com)
	- [Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/ddos-protection)

# Hosting
Let's say that the DDOS protection service at the DNS level, such as CloudFlare isn't enough, that the attacker already has your direct IP address or is able to overpower the current protection tier that you have, and is still getting to your web server and crippling your application.

Another option is to purchase services from a host that offers DDOS protection alongside their normal services. There are a number of options, including some hosts that provide DDOS protection for free with your service, while others allow you to include it as an add-on to their products.

Here are a few hosting companies that provide DDOS protection services:
	- [OVH](https://ovh.com) - They provide it for free with any of their services
	- [BuyVM](https://buyvm.net) - BuyVM offers an add-on for DDOS protection (500 Gbps) for only $3.00/month!
	- [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) - Hetzner is a German company that also offers DDOS protection for free with their services

While the increased attacks have been ramping up in size, the advancement of technology also has increased the effiecincy and effectiveness of filtering and defending these massive attacks. Many of these DDOS protection products are flexible and allow you to filter at multiple layers to help mitigate and limit the effectiveness of these attacks.

If you plan on hosting anything on the internet, it's important to factor in and prepare for a possible attack from a disgruntled user. The most common are gameservers and online communities, so plan accordingly!
