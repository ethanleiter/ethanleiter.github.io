## How To Install Package Updates In Ubuntu
Keeping your system up to date is as important as properly doing oil changes for your car. In Windows and Mac OS, the system has an easy method through the GUI for downloading and installing updates.

Many who use Ubuntu also use the command-line interface, which means unless you have a setting within the system or applied a customization, it will not notify you that updates are available.

However, this can be easily be completed by first running an `apt-get update` which downloads the latest package information from the Ubuntu repositories, and then following it with an `apt-get upgrade` which will then update the installed packages on your Ubuntu system.


*Something to consider:*

In many enterprise environments, running updates can be nerve-wracking as they may break functioning applications that depend on them due to changes in the code of dependent packages. In situations like this, many companies test package updates individually in a development environment so they can prepare and deploy changes in production prior to running their updates.
