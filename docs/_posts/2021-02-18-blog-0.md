# How To Install Cacti Monitoring on Ubuntu

Having a solid monitoring system is important for any company or individual trying to keep track of their services and hardware. Cacti is an excellent (and free) monitoring tool that allows you to quickly obtain metrics on your systems and monitor the machines to ensure nothing is over the limit.

## Update system and packages

It is important to check for updates on dependencies before installing a package to ensure that it is using the latest version for compatibility and security:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

## Install Apache Webserver
Cacti provides a web interface to review and administrate the service, and Apache is recommended as the default webserver for Cacti (though others such as NGINX can be used too):

`sudo apt install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-php`

## Install PHP and Extensions
Cacti's web interface is built off of PHP, so it will need PHP and related extensions to work with Apache in order to successfully display the Cacti interface:

`sudo apt install -y php php-mysql php-snmp pph-curl php-xml php-gd php-ldap php-mbstring php-gmp php-json php-common`

## Install MySQL Database
Alongside using a web interface, Cacti stores data in both a log file and within a database. By default, it uses MySQL, but this can be substituted with MariaDB or other supported relational databases:

`sudo apt install -y mysql-server mysql-client`

## Install SNMP and RRDTool
These are important pieces for Cacti to function, as it utilizes SNMP and other tools in Linux to successfully collect data from the remote device/server, and RRDTool to generate a graph of the data:

`sudo apt install -y snmp snmpd snmp-mibs-downloader rrdtool librrds-perl`

## Configure your system's timezone
In order to understand the logs (and not have to convert between UTC and your local timezone) set the timezone in your system so Cacti will default to it instead of using UTC:

`sudo timedatectl list-timezones` to find your timezone and `sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles` to set it in the system

## Install Cacti
Now that the pre-requisites have been installed and configured, you can proceed with installing Cacti itself, which will also walk you through creating the database and default admin user in the process:

`sudo apt install cacti`


Upon completing the Cacti installation, you can now access the web interface of Cacti and begin adding devices and templates for systems you would like to monitor by accessing it at: http://your.ip/cacti and logging in with the admin user and password that was created during the installation steps.
