## Finding the right monitoring software

Working in IT requires deploying and managing plenty of hardware and software. Ranging from bare-metal servers hosted in a state of the art datacenter to running a MySQL database on your local machine.

However, it is important to be able to keep track of everything within a single page or a small amount of pages, so you can quickly see the status of resources, and whether a device or service is currently up or down.

In order to meet this need, you can find a variety of options, both self-hosted and open source, or premium and hosted online for you.

Here are a few examples:
* [Cacti](https://www.cacti.net)
* [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com)
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com)

The first two options, Cacti and Zabbix, are self-hosted and free to set up. All you'll need is a bit of time and available resources to install the software and configure it for use. The benefits to open source and self-hosted options, is that you'll save money on subscriptions. However, the downside is that you'll need time, patience, and a bit of creativity to get support for the devices and services you'll want to add to the software. As you may not always have the necessary templates available online to use.

The third option, Datadog, is a premium option that is hosted through their web interface. The benefit towards paying for a managed service such as Datadog or its competitors, is that they provide support for their service, including direct integrations to the devices and services you're attempting to monitor. Such as tracking your AWS environment, directly integrating and monitoring your database servers. Paying a premium price instead of free includes the benefit of better support, which allows for easier integrations for monitoring both on-premise and cloud solutions.

It's worth trying out both types, to see which fits best for your needs. If you have the time, patience, and resources then you can benefit from setting up an open source/self-hosted solution and putting it all together over time. Or if you want something that can quickly integrate and deploy, while also having someone to reach if you encounter any issues, then going the premium route for a paid service such as Datadog will fit your need.
